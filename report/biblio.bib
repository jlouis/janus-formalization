  ABSTRACT = {
This article presents the formal verification, using the Coq proof
assistant, of a memory model for low-level imperative languages such
as C and compiler intermediate languages.  Beyond giving semantics
to pointer-based programs, this model supports reasoning over
transformations of such programs.  We show how the properties of the
memory model are used to prove semantic preservation for three passes
of the Compcert verified compiler.}
