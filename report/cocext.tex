\chapter{Extensions to C(co-)iC}

\fixme{Introduce the CiC, read throught this part}
The \coq{} system provides the Calculus of (co-)inductive
constructions. In this system, there are certain properties which are
unprovable but nice to have. In the litterature about \coq{} one can
find certain axioms that can be added safely to the proof system
without making it inconsistent. Great care must be taken, but we know
that adding \emph{Proof irrelevance} and \emph{Extensionality} at the
same time doesn't introduce inconsistencies.

\paragraph{Proof Irrelevance}
\label{sec:proof-irrelevance}

The Irrelevance of proofs state that if we have two ways of proving
the same thing, it is irrelevant which one we look at. They are
decided as being equal. Formally:
\begin{axm}
  Suppose $P$ is any proposition. Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be proofs of
  proposition $P$. In \coq{} this means $p_1$ and $p_2$ are terms of
  type $P$. Then $p_1 = p_2$.
\end{axm}

\paragraph{Extensionality}
\label{sec:extensionality}

The extensionality axiom states that if two functions agree on all
values, then they are equal. Formally:
\begin{axm}
  Suppose we have $f, g \colon A \to B$. Then if $\forall x \in A,
  f(x) = g(x)$ we have $f = g$.
\end{axm}
