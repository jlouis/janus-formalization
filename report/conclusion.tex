\chapter{Conclusion}

In this project we have:
\begin{itemize}
\item Formalized most of JANUS and its main properties, if we
  disregard loops. The formalization is carried out in the \coq{}
  proof assistant.
\item We have uncovered a problem in the formalization of loops.
\item We have shown that the ability to do \emph{hiding} in stores
  yields a pretty solution to the problem ``$x$ must not occur in the
  expression on the right-hand side''.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore we gained important insight in the use of the \coq{}
framework for formalization of computer programs. This insight will
benefit further work with logical frameworks or proof assistants as
many concepts are interchangeable between them.
