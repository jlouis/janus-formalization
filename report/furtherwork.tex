\chapter{Further Work}

This project leaves several venues by which one can continue. First of
all, some might want to finish the work started. This requires that
one devises a new semantics for loops and proves it to be
deterministic in both directions.

The loops in question must be created in such a way that we can use
discrimination to discharge the ``wrong'' cases in an inversion. Any
simple attempt to do this by the author failed, so it requires some
thought getting right.

Second, one might want to add arrays to the language. This is
certainly possible but requires some work getting right. We have
already laid out a general path for doing this.

Third, we could formalize other reversible languages or instruction
set architectures. The hope is, like in the case of JANUS, that we
would gain some newfound knowledge on how to go on about formalizing
reversible languages.
