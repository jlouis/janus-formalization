The crucial insight in this formalization was gained by applying an
idea from the logic LF which is used in Twelf. In LF, the dependently
typed lambda calculus is restricted in a specific way. To control what
the valid terms are, an elaborate set of judgements are
constructed. The main point is that these inference rules drives the
valid forms: any constructed inference tree is valid. The feat is to
take great care when introducing the inference rules.

The same idea has been used in this JANUS formalization. blah blah,
